#ChromeExtensionReddit

I made this tiny extension in the evening of Aug 15, 2019. I use reddit somewhat frequently, and a year or two ago they released a new design which I did not enjoy very much. There's an option to stick with the old style which requires you to be logged in, but I wanted to learn how to make an extension anyway. Besides, there are days when I don't login... like on a slow day at work =)


I may add more functionality on a future date. I'm thinking of perhaps allowing users to input their own redirect rules.
